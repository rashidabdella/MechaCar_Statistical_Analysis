## Overview of Analysis

AutosRUsâ€™ is having some production issues, this job requires the data analytics team to provide analytics to discover new findings that may help the company. 

#### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Below is a linear regression model.

We should reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is far below the .05 range.
The r-squared value shows that there is a very strong correlation.

### Summary of T-Tests

We can conclude to fail to reject the null hypotheses because this scored a p=value of 1 for the first lot, .06 for the second lot. We can reject the null on the last lot because the p-value is under .05.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

#### Questions that can be asked?

What cars have the best values? Is horsepower a good metric for determining fuel efficiency? How can one get the best of both worlds in terms of speed and horsepower. 

What metric or metrics are you going to test?
-I would test the color and value of the car.

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
-The null hypothesis means that there is no correlation however, alternative means that there is a correlation.  

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
-I would use a t-test

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
-We need the price of the vehicle and color as well as the mileage.
